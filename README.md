## Cathrine of Aragon

### About this project
This project about the Queen Cathrine of Aragon was made to give the user a teaser about the special time and personalities that lived at that time in history. The hope is that the user gets inpired to explore and learn more about history, to open up an understanding of why things are as they are in the world as the nowdays is a result of our past.

There is also another reason why it is about Cathrine of Aragon as well, and that is that it was a remarkable woman, and women are usually not that target in modern history, their role in history tends to become a plain shadow of their husbands deeds and importance. This project is an opening-project to more projects that continues the adventure of discovering who else where behind the scenes in our history.

##  Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create wireframes to design and organize the structure of the site.
I did not keep all the information or images since I realized later that it would be too heavy and less interesting for the user. I changed the background-image of the contact-page since the one I choose melts better into the content and I also changed the Logo since this project would only be about Cathrine of Aragon.

This second page is called Gallery because that is whee there are paintings of Cathrine there and starts with the Logo and Navigation- Bar.
I selected paintings of Cathrine of Aragon that where painted by contemporary artists so that we could see more personal portraits of the woman behind the throne, more fragil than later artists painted her.

### Credits

I have borrowed many codes from the Code Institutes page of: <Love Running>, specially the codes about the Animation of the front-image and the codes to adapt the page to different dimensions of the media-screens.

I also received much help from found codes in w3school where I found solutions to fixe the placement of the navigation-bar and the footer and also the images in the Gallery-page.

I borrowed a z-media code to help me with the navigation-bar and many more problems from the tutors and fellow students from the Slack-community.
