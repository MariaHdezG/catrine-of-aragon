                <p> 
                        Arhtur and Cathrine married in 1501 but after only one year Arthur dies.

Now, Cathrine was bethrod to Henry, and declared to the Pope that her first marriage never was consummated. Henry and Cathrine needed to wait 7 years to get married. 
During the waiting Cathrine become the Spanish Ambassador in England in 1507 and doing so, she became the first woman to be an Ambassador.

1509 Cathrine marries to Henry VIII and became his first wife.


Cathrine of Aragon was 23 years when she married  Henry VIII and she was pregnant 6 times while married to Henry VIII. She delivered two sons and a daughter,
 but the sons died shortly after their birth or were stillborn.  Only Mary, their daughter survived. 
 Henry wanted so to have a son who could take over the throne, but since Cathrine could not have more children, Henry decided that he wanted to annulate this marriage too,  but  the Pope did not made it, 
  partly because Cathrine already had passed through that once, and with that was with his brother, so she could marry him.

	<p>
	So Henry and Cathrines marrige was annulated, and Henry forced Cathrine out of the palace and also to leave their daughter Mary behind, to never see her again. 

						Cathrine lived isolated the rest of her life until she  died in cancer at the age of 50 while staying at Kimbolton Castle. Her death happened in January 1536 and her tomb is situated in Peterborough Cathedral, but before she died, she wrote Henry VIII a letter telling him that 
						she forgave him everything and that she  still loved him  and that for her,  he still was her husband.

<p>
Since Cathrines and Henrys marrige was annulated, their daughter Mary lost her legitimity to claim the throne to England, even if she was Henrys firstborn child.
That was something Mary tried to reclaim her whole life without any success.
